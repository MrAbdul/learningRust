1. Book Library System (Basic Version)
Concepts Practiced:

Defining and instantiating structs
Implementing methods on structs
Ownership & references in struct methods
Description:
Create a small program that models a basic library system. You need a struct to represent a Book. Here are some ideas on what your Book might include:

title: String
author: String
year_published: u32
Then, create another struct that represents a Library, which contains a vector of books. Add methods to the Library struct to:

Add a new book (push it to the vector).
List all books currently in the library.
Search for a book by title (and print some details).
Hints:

Think about whether you want these methods to take ownership or just a reference. For example, should your add_book method take ownership of the Book or just a reference &Book?
Decide how you’ll handle the case when a user searches for a book that doesn’t exist (return an Option?).
Extensions:

Add a method for “removing” a book by title.
Track whether each book is currently “checked out,” or keep a list of who has borrowed it.
